Mployd was my first commercial development job and is a job searching application made for iPhone.<br /><br />

The application involved taking a previously created design and implementing it using the iOS SDK and then tying this UI in with Mployd's webservers to display job results.  Users are also able to use their current location to find the jobs that are closest to them.
