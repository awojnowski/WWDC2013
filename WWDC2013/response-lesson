<strong>Describe an important lesson or key learning moment you've experienced developing apps.</strong><br /><br />

The largest lesson that I've learned while developing apps for iOS is how to interface with a professional team and how to manage and work on a large project with multiple developers.<br /><br />

Before my work with Minus Inc, I was a mainly independant developer.  Sure, I had a graphic designer send me graphics now and then but I never really had to work with other developers on a single project.  To manage something, I would keep it on my local harddrive and maybe put it on a USB stick as a backup.  This obviously doesn't scale past a single person and is an atrocious way of managing a software project, but it's really all that I knew.<br /><br />

After Minus hired additional iOS developers past just the singular Aaron, I was thrust into the world of multi-person development.  In this new world I learned how to use Git for source control, GitHub as an online repository for source code, and also how to divvy up work between developers.<br /><br />

During my time with Minus, unfortunately there was some friction on the iOS development team.  One of our programmers hired to work on the application for its initial launch had different programming practices than what was accepted among the team, to put it nicely.  In my years with iOS I had barely worked with others at all and now there was someone who didn't interface well with the rest of the team.  It was very interesting to see how the whole situation was dealt with.  Looking back, I learned that if I had issues with certain code or the way that something was written, it was best to bring it up and be straightforward rather than sugarcoating and convuluting what I really wanted to say.  ex. Just calling something "different" when really it would bog down the project with technical debt in the future isn't the best plan.<br /><br />

With the knowledge that I learned as part of the Minus team, I was able to start new projects and immediately follow best practices to allow for future scaling and inclusion of other developers.  The knowledge was specifically valuable during the development of Musi, which is my own side project.<br /><br />

There have obviously been other learning experiences when working with iOS and developing apps, but I feel that being able to work with people is probably the most important of all since it expands past just working with iOS.
