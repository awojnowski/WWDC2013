AppStorage was an application that I created, sold on the App Store, and then sold to a buyer.  

In a nutshell, the application converted your phone to a USB stick using iTunes' file transfer SDK.  At its launch, AppStorage allowed you to unzip zip files, view photos, listen to audio and watch video, open/view/create documents, create and delete folders to manage the files, and much more.
