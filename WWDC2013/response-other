Musi and Minus are my two most notable projects at this point in time.  However, I've worked on a large series of iOS applications beyond these.  These applications include, but aren't limited to:

    - Interactive mall kiosk and mapping application for a mall in Arizona.
  
    - Troubleshoot - My first application which allowed you to access information on how to fix issues such as water damage.
  
    - DestinationDoc - I provided light contracting work on this application and implemented some server architecture and front end iOS code.
  
    - Mployd - I was contracted to write the entire iOS application.  It was my first commercial job.
  
    - MyCityTopTens - I created a system where businesses could be added to a database and these businesses could then be viewed in an iOS client.
    
    - Fortune Master - A cool, little fortune cookie app.
    
    - FlashlightME - I was contracted to create a flashlight application with custom animations and customizable backgrounds.
