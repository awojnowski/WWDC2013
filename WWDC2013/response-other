Musi and Minus are my two most notable projects at this point in time.  However, I've worked on a large series of iOS applications beyond these.  These applications include, but aren't limited to:<br /><br />

<ul>
    <li>Interactive mall kiosk and mapping application for a mall in Arizona.</li>
    <li><strong>Troubleshoot</strong> - My first application which allowed you to access information on how to fix issues such as water damage.</li>
    <li><strong>DestinationDoc</strong> - I provided light contracting work on this application and implemented some server architecture and front end iOS code.</li>
    <li><strong>Mployd</strong> - I was contracted to write the entire iOS application.  It was my first commercial job.</li>
    <li><strong>MyCityTopTens</strong> - I created a system where businesses could be added to a database and these businesses could then be viewed in an iOS client.</li>
    <li><strong>Fortune Master</strong> - A cool, little fortune cookie app.</li>
    <li><strong>FlashlightME</strong> - I was contracted to create a flashlight application with custom animations and customizable backgrounds.</li>
</ul><br />
