Musi and Minus are my two most notable projects at this point in time.  However, I've worked on a large series of iOS applications beyond these.  These applications include, but aren't limited to:<br /><br />

<ul>
    <li>Interactive mall kiosk and mapping application for a mall in Arizona.</li>
    <li>Troubleshoot - My first application which allowed you to access information on how to fix issues such as water damage.</li>
    <li>DestinationDoc - I provided light contracting work on this application and implemented some server architecture and front end iOS code.</li>
    <li>Mployd - I was contracted to write the entire iOS application.  It was my first commercial job.</li>
    <li>MyCityTopTens - I created a system where businesses could be added to a database and these businesses could then be viewed in an iOS client.</li>
    <li>Fortune Master - A cool, little fortune cookie app.</li>
    <li>FlashlightME - I was contracted to create a flashlight application with custom animations and customizable backgrounds.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
