I've also worked on many projects beyond those represented as icons on the iPhone.  Some of these other projects include:<br /><br />

<ul>
    <li>Interactive mall kiosk and mapping application for a mall in Arizona.</li>
    <li><strong>Troubleshoot</strong> - My first application which allowed you to access information on how to fix issues such as water damage.</li>
    <li><strong>DestinationDoc</strong> - I provided light contracting work on this application and implemented some server architecture and front end iOS code.</li>
    <li><strong>Fortune Master</strong> - A cool, little fortune cookie app.</li>
</ul><br />
