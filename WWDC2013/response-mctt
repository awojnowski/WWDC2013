MyCityTopTens is an application that allows you to view the top venues (such as restaurants, bars, etc) in a selected city.<br /><br />

This was my second commercial application that I created.  I was in charge of creating a front end website, back end to add venues, API to access venues on the go, and finally an iOS client to browse these venues.
