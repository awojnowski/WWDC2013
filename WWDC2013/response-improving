<strong>Think about an app you frequently use.  How would you improve it?</strong><br /><br />

There is one application that is above all others right now.  The App Store app.<br /><br />

As a developer, having people download your app is everything.  Without downloads, one has absolutely no way to be successful in the App Store.  It's really bad if there is actually no decent way to do download apps, though.<br /><br />

Firstly, one of the largest issue in my opinion is the placement of loading indicators.  When the App Store loads content, it just displays a white background until the content is loaded in and while the content in loading, there is a tiny indicator in the status bar.  This would be acceptable if the content loaded at a decent pace but it never really does.  I regularly notice loading times in excess of 10 seconds.  I also can't count all the times where I've gone to browse the App Store on 3G only to stare at a white screen for a minute.  At that point I'm wondering if the request failed, if it's still loading, etc.  Having an indicator actually in the application during loading would provide a better visual indicator of when loading is actually occuring.  This especially is important with the updates tab, since that doesn't seem to display results 2/3 of the times that I visit it.<br /><br />

This next change sort of goes hand in hand with the first improvement.  The App Store needs to indicate when errors occur and provide a way to get out of the errored state.  If a request fails, I don't want to see a white screen and I'm sure that nobody else wants to either.  Having the option to reload and just saying something simple like "Error loading content, please try again" would make a world of difference and would actually let the end user know if something went wrong.  Then again, maybe it already does this and I just haven't let it load long enough.  Can't really tell though because there's no reliable loading indicator ;-).<br /><br />

Search results are absolutely huge in the App Store.  Loads of users find their apps through search so having a compelling search experience is paramount.  When iOS 6 was released, search went from a table view to single tiles that could be horizontally swiped.  This cut down on the amount of applications that could be instantly viewed in search and reduced the amount of downloads that one could get from search, due to the low amount of displayed apps.  As a developer, you used to be able to get decent search downloads when ranking even as far as 30th for a keyword but now you're out of luck if you're any further down than rank five since people will rarely keep swiping that far.<br /><br />

When Musi was launched, we had a severe search issue.  How severe?  You could only find the app by searching "Musi Christian Lunny" since searching "Musi" silently corrected to "Music" (and we wouldn't rank for this term in a million years as a new app).  I think this has been fixed now, since we're searchable, but improving the search algorithm to return exact application names first and then the rest of the results would be much appreciated and would mitigate issues like what happened with Musi.<br /><br />

Reviews are another weak point in the App Store, in my opinion.  The review system as it stands right now is extremely one sided.  If someone makes a bad review, it's there and has absolutely no way of being modified.  I think that there should be a system in place where as a developer, I could respond to reviews either privately or publicly.  There have been cases with Musi where someone was unable to find a feature and therefore rated the app low.  As a developer, I could not only direct them where to find the feature but I could also let readers know that this bad review isn't fully true.<br /><br />

Finally, I'd love to see a better category search.  Organic application discovery is really important for new applications.  Having the ability to view categories and the top applications within these categories in a better way than waiting for an extremely slow modal view controller in the top charts tab would make a world of difference.  When checking my App Store rankings, I see that I'm ranked in top Music apps or top Social Networking apps.  This doesn't really matter, though, since people will really rarely visit these categories.  I know I certainly don't when searching for apps.<br /><br />
