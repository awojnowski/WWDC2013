I figured that this would be important to include, considering I'm applying for a student scholarship to WWDC.

Why do you want to go to WWDC?

Last year I had the privilege of going to WWDC on a student scholarship.  Originally, I thought that going to WWDC was just going to be about learning the new iOS technologies and was going to be left at that.  However, what I found was that WWDC was much more than that.  It was not only a place to learn but a place to be inspired.  This year, I hope to go to WWDC not only to get a jump on and work with the new technologies that iOS 7 is going to introduce, but to also get some of that fire and some of that kick back that I felt last year when attending the conference.  

In addition to the inspiration and excellent talks, it would be incredible to be able to attend the Keynote, Stump, the Apple Design Awards, and finally see some of the amazing lunch time speakers.  Hearing from JJ Abrams as well as William Joyce last year was an unexpected highlight for me and I know that the speakers this year would probably deliver just the same, if not more.
