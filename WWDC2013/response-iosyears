<strong>How many years have you been developing for iOS or OS X?</strong><br /><br />

I've been developing for iOS for three years.<br /><br />

In ninth grade, a friend of mine encountered some issues with his iPod Touch.  I was considered to be the "computer" person to go to at that time and he came to me asking if I could fix it for a small fee.  After an hour of Googling, I managed to get the iPod restored and in order.  A few months later and after a few more small iPod related deeds, I purchased my own iPod Touch and basically fell in love with what the device was capable of.<br /><br />

As time progressed with my iPod, I found that I was no longer satisfied with the applications that others had available and I thought about how cool it would be to actually create my own iOS application.  Being a Windows person at the time, I was unable to install the native SDK to get into development and had to look  into alternative SDKs such as DragonFireSDK and PhoneGap.  After a little while experimenting with alternatives, I realized that nothing compared to what could be accomplished with the native iOS SDK and sought out to buy a Mac computer.<br /><br />

Being only 14 at the time, this computer purchase was huge for me and I didn't have the funds at the time to afford such a purchase.  Luckily for me, my dad needed a program written for Microsoft Access that would allow his company to process purchase orders.  In return for creating this program, he would give me the money that I needed to make my purchase.  Three weeks later, I was walking out of the Apple Store holding a shiny new iMac.<br /><br />

When I first started iOS development, the barrier of entry was enormous since I had absolutely no computer science or programming knowledge at the time.  The allure of the App Store was much greater than this barrier, though, and after two months after buying my Mac I launched Troubleshoot.  Two months later I launched my first game for the iOS platform and three months after that I landed my first commercial iOS development job.<br /><br />

The iOS SDK introduced me to programming and the iOS platform is by far my favorite to develop for.  I've experimented with Windows Phone development, Android development, and web development but none of it compares to writing apps for iOS.
