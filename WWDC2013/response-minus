In addition to developing Musi, I am also one of the developers of Minus.  Minus is an NYC based startup whos application allows users to share photos with and chat with people nearby.<br /><br />

The Minus iOS team is growing and currently has three developers.  Generally I am tasked with working on the photo viewer, user profile views, photo mosaic/masonry view, profile settings, API/model layer, phone number verification, contact viewing, and image uploading.<br /><br />

Most of my Minus work consists of working with UIKit and CoreAnimation and coordinating with our designers to provide a wonderful user experience to display data returned by the Minus API.<br /><br />
