In addition to developing Musi, I am also one of the developers of Minus.  Minus is an NYC based startup whos application allows users to share photos with and chat with people nearby.

The Minus iOS team is growing and currently has three developers.  Generally I am tasked with working on the photo viewer, user profile views, photo mosaic/masonry view, profile settings, API/model layer, phone number verification, contact viewing, and image uploading.

Most of my Minus work consists of working with UIKit and CoreAnimation and coordinating with our designers to provide a wonderful user experience to display data returned by the Minus API.
