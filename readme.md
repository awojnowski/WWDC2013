This is my student scholarship iOS application for WWDC 2013.

The application incorporates a custom table view and a custom scroll view to provide a parallax scrolling effect whilst displaying information about my personal and professional life.

For those that do not wish to build or download the application, here are some screenshots.  Keep in mind that you can't experience all of the parallaxy goodness through just images though!
